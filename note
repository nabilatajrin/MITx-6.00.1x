prob:
-how to check if a variable is string or int
-prob: 4 > 5 or 3 < 4 and 9 > 8 prints true, but logically i get it as false, what is the precedence?


note:
-to concatenate string and int, int should be type casted to string
-int/int = float
-occurence of a word nonstop:
    s = "azcbobobbobegghakl"
    countBob = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i:].startswith('bob'):
            countBob += 1
    print(("Number of times bob occurs is: ") + str(countBob))


-two new kinds of data structures,
    things called "tuples," and things called "lists."
    Let's start with the tuple.
    A "tuple" is an ordered sequence of elements
    which can include any different kind of element within them.

-One of the issues about tuples is that they're immutable
